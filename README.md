# C++ Structured Programming
<h2>Multiple Structural programming exercises in C++ that I have solved. FCSE 23/24</h2> <br>
Folders labeled with numbers are laboratory exercises, meanwhile folders labeled Side Exercises are mostly exercises from the first midterm, and the folder Advanced SP means exercises that I have solved for the second midterm/exam. <br>
There might be some exercises unfinished, so feel free to do them yourself if you wish. Also if you run upon a task that is not correct, feel free to contact me via email fejmiqaz@gmail.com.
