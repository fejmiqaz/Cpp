### Task 1:
From SI read characters until you read the char !. In these characters are hidden integers (smaller than 100). Write a program that will read all characters and print the sum of all integers hidden in the text.
### Task 2:
Using the characters + and - form a square image with "width" n (n > 2) that represent square of the chars -, enclosed by a square of chars + (view examples). For given n, print the appropriate image.

Attention: do not print additional characters as empty spaces, or unnecessary new line... The image ends with new line char. Do not use any matrix or arrays because n is not limited.
### Task 3:
From SI are read N pairs of integers, where the first number is the students' points, and the second is the max. points. Write a program where for each pair (points, max points), will print the students success in percentage and his grade following these rules:

if the student has 90% or more - "10",
if the student has 80% or more - "9",
if the student has 70% or more - "8",
if the student has 60% or more - "7",
if the student has 50% or more - "6",
If the student has less than 50% print "FAIL".
### Task 4:
One number is interesting if his flipped number is divisible by the number of digits it contains. The flipped number is composed from the same digits, but in opposite order (ex. 653 is flipped of the number 356). Read from SI one integer n ( n > 9). Find and print the largest integer small than n that is "interesting". If the read number is not valid print a message "The number is invalid".
### Task 5:
Read from SI one integer n. From the integers smaller than n, find the one with maximum sum of divisors. Do not count the number itself in the sum of divisors.
### Task 6:
Write a program in which from the standard input you read one positive integer z, and afterwards you read one after another pairs of integers (a, b). Thereby, the loop should end if you read the pair (0, 0). The program should calculate how many times the integer z is equal to the sum of the pairs a and b, as well as the percentage of the pairs (a,b) that give sum equal to z (NOTE: the pair (0,0) is not taken into account when doing calculations!).
### Task 7:
Three natural numbers А, B and C are entered from the SI.

Write a program that will check if the three entered numbers can represent the values of the angles (in degrees) of a triangle. If the values can represent angles of a triangle print YES in the first line of the standard output followed by type of the triangle (RIGHT, ACUTE or OBTUSE) in the next line. If triangle is not possible with the tree given angles print NO in a single line.
### Task 8:
A whole number N greater then 0 is entered from the SI followed by N pairs of natural numbers greater than 10. Write a program that for every pair of entered numbers will check if the number obtained by moving the last digit of the first number on its first place is greater that the second number in the pair or not. Print YES if the condition is satisfied or NO if the condition is not satisfied on the standard output in a single line for each pair of numbers.

(Example for moving the last digit of a number on its first place: 1234 -> 4123, 98700 -> 9870). If the numbers 3456 and 6210 are entered as a pair YES should be printed since 6345 > 6210.
### Task 9:
Sweet number is number that contains only even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). In given range (m and n read from SI) find the smallest "sweet number". If there is no such number, print NSN.
